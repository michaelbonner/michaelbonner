# Michael Bonner

Hi! I'm a web and mobile app developer based in Salt Lake City, Utah, USA. I've been making websites, web applications, and mobile apps for almost 20 years, and I've learned a bunch along the way. I specialize in helping businesses understand the problems they are trying to solve and crafting simple solutions to solve those problems. I'm always down to talk about code if you find something in one of my repos. Hit me up on LinkedIn or reach out to me on my Bootpack Digital site if you have questions or need some help on a project.
